# HEART-ATTACK-PREDICTION

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death worldwide over the last few decades in the developed as well as underdeveloped and developing countries. Early detection of cardiac diseases and continuous supervision of clinicians can reduce the mortality rate. However, accurate detection of heart diseases in all cases and consultation of a patient for 24 hours by a doctor is not available since it requires more sapience, time and expertise. 
In this study, a tentative design of a ML-based heart disease prediction system had been proposed to detect impending heart disease using Machine learning techniques. For the accurate detection of the heart disease, an efficient machine learning technique should be used which had been derived from a distinctive analysis among several machine learning algorithms in a Python Platform. The proposed algorithm is a logistic regression technique which is a classification algorithm, by this using the parameters one can predict that if a person will be effected by a heart attack or not.
